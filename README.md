# Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of an Autoencoder, a type of deep learning model, for detecting malware in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The algorithm is trained on network traffic data, learning to reconstruct 'normal' instances with the goal of identifying anomalous instances which can be indicative of malware activity.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing is the CTU-IoT-Malware-Capture dataset. It consists of network traffic data generated by IoT devices, some of which have been compromised to perform malicious activities.

# Methodology
The Autoencoder model used in this project is a multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture, composed of an Encoder and a Decoder. The Encoder progressively compresses the input data, learning a lower-dimensional representation. The Decoder then attempts to reconstruct the original data from this compressed representation. In the context of anomaly detection, the model is trained only on 'normal' instances. Therefore, when it encounters an anomalous instance, it will likely have a high reconstruction error, serving as an indicator of an anomaly.

# Model Architecture
The Encoder consists of five Dense layers, with dimensions reducing from 203 to 10. The Decoder mirrors this architecture, with dimensions increasing from 10 back to 203. The Autoencoder is then constructed by stacking the Encoder and Decoder.

# Model Training
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and the Huber loss function. Training involves presenting the model with 'normal' instances, and using backpropagation to adjust the model weights based on the reconstruction error.

# Performance Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated on a test set, with performance metrics including accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score calculated for assessment. Furthermore, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and confusion matrix visualizations are generated for better understanding of model performance.\
